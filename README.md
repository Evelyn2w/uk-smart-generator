# UK49s Smart Number Generator

The **UK49s Smart Number Generator** is a lightweight, web-based tool designed to help users generate strategic number combinations for the UK49s **Lunchtime** and **Teatime** lottery draws. Unlike purely random generators, this tool uses a **weighted logic system** based on hot and cold numbers, giving users a smarter approach to number selection.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

Many lottery players rely on past trends, hot numbers, and statistics to make informed decisions. This generator mimics that behavior by prioritizing historically frequent numbers (hot numbers) while occasionally including less frequent numbers (cold numbers) for balance. The goal is to provide an enhanced prediction experience without requiring complex calculations or spreadsheets.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **Smart prediction algorithm** using weighted randomness  
- ✅ **Two separate modes**: Lunchtime and Teatime  
- ✅ **Hot and cold number selection logic** for smarter choices  
- ✅ **Responsive user interface** optimized for both desktop and mobile  
- ✅ **Instant results** — no page reload required  
- ✅ Built using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no external dependencies)
